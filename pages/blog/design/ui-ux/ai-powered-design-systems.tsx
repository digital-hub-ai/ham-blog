            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Convergence of AI and Design Systems</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The intersection of artificial intelligence and design systems represents one of the most transformative developments 
              in digital product creation. As organizations scale their design efforts across multiple platforms, teams, and 
              products, traditional manual approaches to maintaining design consistency have reached their limits. AI-powered 
              design systems leverage machine learning algorithms to automate repetitive tasks, enforce design standards, 
              and accelerate the creation of cohesive user interfaces.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern AI systems analyze vast repositories of design assets to identify patterns, inconsistencies, and opportunities 
              for optimization. These intelligent tools can automatically generate component variants, suggest improvements to 
              existing design tokens, and even predict which components might be needed for upcoming features based on project 
              requirements and historical usage data.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Automated Component Generation</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              One of the most significant advances in AI-powered design systems is the ability to automatically generate 
              production-ready components from high-fidelity designs. Designers can create mockups in their preferred tools, 
              and AI algorithms translate these visual representations into fully functional code components complete with 
              proper accessibility attributes, responsive behaviors, and integration with existing design tokens.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-rose-50 border border-rose-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-800">Designer's Tip</h3>
              <p>
                Establish clear design principle guidelines before implementing AI generation tools. Well-defined design 
                principles help AI systems make better decisions when interpreting ambiguous design elements and generating 
                appropriate component structures.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Intelligent Design Token Management</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Design tokens form the foundation of scalable design systems, but managing them across large organizations 
              has traditionally been a manual and error-prone process. AI-powered systems now monitor token usage across 
              all products and platforms, automatically identifying inconsistencies and suggesting optimizations. These 
              systems can detect when similar colors or spacing values are being used inconsistently and recommend 
              consolidation to improve system coherence.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Advanced AI tools also predict how design token changes might impact existing components and interfaces, 
              providing risk assessments before implementing system-wide updates. This predictive capability enables 
              design teams to make confident changes that enhance consistency without breaking existing functionality.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Real-time Accessibility Compliance</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Ensuring accessibility compliance is both a legal requirement and a moral imperative, but manually checking 
              interfaces for WCAG conformance is time-consuming and prone to oversight. AI-powered design systems continuously 
              monitor components and layouts for accessibility issues, providing immediate feedback during the design process.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              These systems evaluate color contrast ratios, text sizing, interactive element sizing, and keyboard navigation 
              flows automatically. When potential issues are detected, the AI suggests specific remedies and can even 
              automatically adjust design properties to meet compliance standards while preserving visual intent.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Predictive Component Recommendations</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Machine learning algorithms analyze historical project data, user interaction patterns, and feature requirements 
              to predict which components and design patterns will be most effective for new initiatives. This predictive 
              capability accelerates the design process by presenting teams with proven solutions tailored to their specific 
              context and objectives.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As AI systems accumulate more data about successful designs and user responses, their recommendations become 
              increasingly sophisticated and accurate. This continuous learning process creates a virtuous cycle where 
              design systems evolve to become more effective tools for creating successful digital products. The future 
              of design lies in the seamless collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence, where 
              each amplifies the strengths of the other to create experiences that neither could achieve alone.
