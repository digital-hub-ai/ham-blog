            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Imperative for Sustainable Design</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              As environmental consciousness reaches unprecedented levels in 2025, product designers 
              face increasing pressure to create solutions that minimize ecological impact throughout 
              their lifecycle. Sustainable design has evolved from a niche consideration to a 
              fundamental requirement that influences purchasing decisions, brand perception, and 
              regulatory compliance.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Today's consumers demand transparency about environmental impact, seeking products 
              that align with their values while delivering exceptional functionality and aesthetics. 
              This shift has prompted designers to reimagine traditional approaches, integrating 
              sustainability considerations from concept to disposal rather than treating them as 
              afterthoughts.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Material Innovation and Selection</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The sustainable design landscape in 2025 is characterized by innovative materials 
              that reduce environmental impact without compromising performance. Bio-based plastics, 
              mycelium composites, and recycled ocean plastics offer alternatives to traditional 
              materials while providing unique aesthetic qualities that differentiate products 
              in competitive markets.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-rose-50 border border-rose-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-800">Designer's Insight</h3>
              <p>
                Material selection should consider the entire supply chain, including sourcing, 
                processing, transportation, and end-of-life scenarios. Local materials often 
                provide better environmental outcomes than exotic alternatives despite similar 
                performance characteristics.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Circular Design Strategies</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Circular design principles focus on keeping materials and products in use for as 
              long as possible through strategies like design for disassembly, modular construction, 
              and upgradeability. Products designed with circularity in mind can be easily repaired, 
              refurbished, or recycled at the end of their useful life.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Service-based business models complement circular design by shifting ownership 
              from consumers to manufacturers who maintain responsibility for product lifecycle 
              management. This approach incentivizes durable construction and facilitates 
              efficient material recovery while providing consumers with access to the latest 
              technology without contributing to electronic waste.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Lifecycle Assessment Integration</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern design processes incorporate comprehensive lifecycle assessments that 
              quantify environmental impact from raw material extraction through disposal or 
              recycling. These evaluations inform design decisions by highlighting areas where 
              interventions can yield the greatest environmental benefits.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Digital twin technologies enable designers to simulate and optimize product 
              performance and environmental impact before physical prototypes are created. 
              This virtual approach reduces material waste during development while providing 
              detailed insights into real-world performance and sustainability outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Consumer Engagement and Education</h2>
            
            <p>
              Sustainable products require active participation from consumers to realize their 
              environmental benefits. Clear communication about proper use, maintenance, and 
              end-of-life options empowers users to maximize product lifespan and facilitate 
              responsible disposal. Interactive digital manuals, augmented reality maintenance 
              guides, and community support platforms enhance user engagement while reinforcing 
              sustainable behaviors.
