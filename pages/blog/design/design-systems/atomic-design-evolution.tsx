            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Beyond Components: Holistic Design Systems</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The design systems landscape in 2025 has evolved far beyond simple component libraries 
              to encompass comprehensive frameworks that unify design principles, development 
              practices, and organizational workflows. Modern design systems function as 
              infrastructure layers that enable consistent, efficient product creation at scale 
              while maintaining flexibility for innovation and brand differentiation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              This evolution reflects the growing complexity of digital product ecosystems, 
              where consistency across multiple platforms, devices, and touchpoints requires 
              more sophisticated coordination mechanisms than isolated component collections 
              can provide. Today's design systems integrate seamlessly with development 
              workflows, content management systems, and business processes to create unified 
              digital experiences.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Intelligent Component Architecture</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Contemporary design systems leverage AI-powered component architecture that 
              automatically generates variants based on usage patterns and design requirements. 
              These intelligent systems learn from designer and developer interactions to 
              suggest optimal component configurations and identify opportunities for 
              consolidation or expansion.
            </p>
            
            <div class="bg-rose-50 border border-rose-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-800">Architect's Insight</h3>
              <p>
                Focus on creating adaptable foundations rather than prescriptive templates. 
                The most successful design systems provide guardrails that ensure consistency 
                while enabling teams to solve unique problems without reinventing core 
                principles. Balance standardization with flexibility to foster innovation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Design Token Evolution</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Design tokens have evolved into sophisticated semantic systems that capture 
              not just visual properties but also behavioral and experiential qualities. 
              Modern token systems encode accessibility requirements, performance constraints, 
              and brand personality attributes that influence how design properties manifest 
              across different contexts and user needs.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Context-aware tokens adapt to environmental factors like lighting conditions, 
              user preferences, and device capabilities to ensure optimal experiences across 
              diverse situations. These dynamic systems maintain brand consistency while 
              accommodating the varied contexts in which digital products are consumed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Collaborative Governance Models</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Effective design systems require governance models that balance centralized 
              oversight with distributed contribution. Modern systems implement federated 
              governance structures where core principles are maintained centrally while 
              teams retain autonomy to extend and customize components for their specific 
              needs.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Contribution workflows democratize system evolution by enabling designers and 
              developers across organizations to propose improvements, share solutions, and 
              participate in system stewardship. These collaborative approaches harness 
              collective intelligence while maintaining quality standards and architectural 
              integrity.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Measurement and Continuous Improvement</h2>
            
            <p>
              Sophisticated analytics and feedback mechanisms provide insights into system 
              adoption, effectiveness, and areas for improvement. Usage telemetry reveals 
              which components are most valuable, where friction exists in workflows, and 
              how design systems impact product development velocity and quality.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Regular health checks and maturity assessments ensure that design systems 
              continue to meet evolving organizational needs. These evaluations examine 
              technical performance, user satisfaction, and business impact to guide 
              investment decisions and prioritize enhancement efforts. The most successful 
              design systems treat continuous improvement as an integral practice rather 
              than a periodic initiative.
