            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Luxury of Simplicity</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              In 2025, minimalism has evolved beyond mere aesthetic preference to become 
              a sophisticated design philosophy that communicates luxury through restraint. 
              This contemporary interpretation recognizes that true elegance lies not 
              in abundance but in the careful curation of essential elements. Modern 
              minimalist design demonstrates confidence through omission, allowing 
              carefully chosen components to shine without competition from 
              superfluous distractions.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The "less is luxe" approach reflects cultural shifts toward mindfulness 
              and intentionality, where consumers increasingly value experiences and 
              objects that promote clarity and focus. This mindset has transformed 
              minimalism from a stark, clinical aesthetic into a warm, inviting 
              design language that feels both sophisticated and accessible.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">White Space as Luxury</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Contemporary minimalist design treats white space not as empty void 
              but as a precious resource to be allocated strategically. This 
              elevated approach to negative space creates visual breathing room 
              that allows design elements to exist comfortably without competing 
              for attention. The generous use of white space communicates 
              confidence in the power of individual elements while providing 
              viewers with a restful visual experience.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-rose-50 border border-rose-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-800">Designer's Insight</h3>
              <p>
                Resist the urge to fill every available space. White space is not 
                wasted space—it's an opportunity to give your design elements 
                room to breathe and express themselves fully. Trust your audience 
                to engage with fewer, better-chosen elements rather than overwhelming 
                them with excessive visual information.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Typography as Hero</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              In minimalist design, typography assumes heroic proportions, 
              becoming the primary vehicle for visual impact and brand 
              communication. This elevated role requires careful consideration 
              of typeface selection, spacing, and hierarchy to ensure that 
              text elements carry the full weight of visual communication 
              without supporting imagery or decorative elements.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Contemporary minimalist typography embraces subtle variations 
              in weight, spacing, and scale to create visual interest while 
              maintaining overall simplicity. Letterforms become sculptural 
              elements that command attention through their refined presence 
              rather than through ornamental embellishment or complex layouts.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Material and Color Intentionality</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern minimalist design approaches material and color selection 
              with unprecedented discernment, choosing each element for its 
              specific contribution to the overall composition. This 
              intentional approach often results in monochromatic or 
              limited palettes where subtle variations in texture, 
              finish, or tone create sophisticated visual depth.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The emphasis on quality over quantity extends to material 
              selection, where premium substrates, finishes, and printing 
              techniques elevate simple designs into luxurious experiences. 
              This attention to tactile qualities acknowledges that 
              contemporary minimalist design engages multiple senses, 
              creating holistic experiences that feel substantial and 
              valuable despite their visual restraint.
