            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Evolution of Color in Digital Spaces</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The digital revolution has fundamentally transformed how we perceive and interact with color. Unlike traditional print media, 
              digital displays emit light directly, creating more vibrant and saturated color experiences. As we advance into 2025, 
              understanding these digital nuances has become essential for creating emotionally resonant visual experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern screens offer unprecedented color gamuts and dynamic range capabilities, allowing designers to explore richer, 
              more nuanced palettes than ever before. However, this expanded potential comes with new responsibilities – ensuring 
              accessibility, maintaining consistency across devices, and understanding how digital color behaves differently than 
              its printed counterparts.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Cultural Variations in Color Perception</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Color associations vary dramatically across cultures, making global digital design particularly challenging. While red 
              symbolizes luck and prosperity in Chinese culture, it represents danger or urgency in Western contexts. Blue, often 
              associated with trust and professionalism in Western markets, carries different connotations in various Eastern cultures.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-rose-50 border border-rose-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-800">Designer's Insight</h3>
              <p>
                When designing for global audiences, create culturally modular color systems that allow for regional adaptations 
                while maintaining brand recognition. This approach preserves core identity while respecting cultural sensitivities 
                and preferences.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Emotional Impact and User Behavior</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Colors directly influence user emotions and behaviors, affecting everything from purchase decisions to time spent 
              on a website. Warm colors like red and orange tend to create feelings of excitement and urgency, making them popular 
              for call-to-action buttons and promotional materials. Cool colors like blue and green evoke calmness and trust, 
              often used in financial and healthcare applications.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The intensity and saturation of colors also play crucial roles in emotional response. Highly saturated colors grab 
              attention but can overwhelm users if overused, while muted tones create sophisticated, calming experiences. 
              Understanding these psychological triggers allows designers to craft intentional emotional journeys through 
              digital interfaces.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Accessibility and Inclusive Design</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Inclusive color design considers users with various visual impairments, including color blindness which affects 
              approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women worldwide. Designers must ensure adequate contrast ratios between 
              text and backgrounds, avoid relying solely on color to convey information, and test palettes with accessibility 
              simulation tools.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern design systems incorporate accessibility-first approaches, building contrast and readability considerations 
              directly into color palettes. This proactive methodology ensures that beautiful designs remain functional and 
              inclusive for all users, regardless of their visual capabilities.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Technological Considerations</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Display technologies continue evolving rapidly, with OLED, QLED, and MicroLED screens offering different color 
              reproduction characteristics. HDR (High Dynamic Range) displays expand the range of brightness and color that 
              can be displayed, requiring designers to consider how their palettes will appear across this spectrum.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Variable lighting conditions also affect color perception. Designs viewed primarily outdoors require different 
              considerations than those consumed in controlled indoor environments. Adaptive color systems that respond to 
              ambient lighting conditions represent an emerging frontier in responsive design.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Future Trends in Digital Color</h2>
            
            <p>
              Looking toward the future, augmented and virtual reality technologies introduce entirely new dimensions of 
              color experience. These immersive environments allow for unprecedented control over lighting, atmosphere, 
              and color interaction, opening possibilities for emotional design that transcend traditional screen boundaries. 
              As these technologies mature, color psychology principles will need to evolve to address three-dimensional, 
              fully immersive color experiences.
