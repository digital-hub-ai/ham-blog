            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Variable Font Revolution</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The typography landscape in 2025 is dominated by variable fonts, a technology that allows designers 
              to access infinite variations of a typeface within a single font file. This innovation has 
              revolutionized how designers approach typography, enabling real-time adjustments to weight, width, 
              slant, and other typographic axes without loading multiple font files.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Variable fonts reduce page load times while expanding creative possibilities, allowing for 
              responsive typography that adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, reading distances, and 
              user preferences. Designers can now create typographic systems that respond to environmental 
              factors like ambient lighting or user interaction, creating more engaging and accessible 
              reading experiences.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Kinetic Typography and Animation</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Kinetic typography has evolved from simple animations to sophisticated storytelling tools 
              that breathe life into written content. In 2025, designers leverage advanced animation 
              libraries and real-time rendering engines to create typographic experiences that respond 
              to user behavior, data inputs, and environmental conditions.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-rose-50 border border-rose-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-800">Designer's Insight</h3>
              <p>
                When incorporating kinetic typography, always prioritize readability and user experience 
                over visual spectacle. Animated text should enhance meaning rather than distract from it. 
                Subtle movements and transformations often have more impact than complex animations.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Responsive Typographic Systems</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern responsive typography goes beyond simple size adjustments to encompass modular 
              typographic systems that adapt to different contexts and devices. These systems consider 
              factors like reading distance, screen resolution, viewing angle, and even user vision 
              capabilities to optimize typography for each specific situation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Container queries and advanced CSS techniques enable typography that responds to its 
              immediate environment rather than just viewport dimensions. This granular control allows 
              for more precise typographic treatment that maintains readability and aesthetic quality 
              across diverse contexts, from smartwatch displays to large-format digital signage.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">AI-Assisted Type Design</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Artificial intelligence has transformed type design by accelerating the creation of custom 
              typefaces and enabling personalized typography at scale. AI tools can generate entire font 
              families based on stylistic preferences, optimize letterforms for specific use cases, and 
              even create adaptive type systems that evolve based on user interaction data.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              These AI-assisted workflows don't replace human creativity but rather augment it, 
              handling routine tasks like kerning adjustments and glyph consistency while freeing 
              designers to focus on conceptual and artistic aspects of type design. The result is 
              higher quality typography produced more efficiently than ever before.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Accessibility and Inclusive Typography</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Inclusive typography design considers the diverse needs of all users, including those 
              with visual impairments, dyslexia, and other reading challenges. Features like 
              adjustable letter spacing, specialized typefaces for dyslexic readers, and high-contrast 
              text options are now standard considerations in typographic systems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Emerging technologies like eye-tracking interfaces and brain-computer interfaces 
              promise to further revolutionize how we interact with typography. These innovations 
              will enable typography that responds to user attention, reading speed, and comprehension 
              levels, creating truly personalized reading experiences that adapt in real-time to 
              individual needs and preferences.
