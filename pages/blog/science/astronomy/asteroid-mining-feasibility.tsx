            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Asteroid mining represents one of the most ambitious endeavors in human history, promising access to vast quantities of rare metals and minerals that are becoming increasingly scarce on Earth. Near-Earth asteroids contain enormous deposits of platinum, palladium, rhodium, and other precious metals, along with iron, nickel, and cobalt in quantities that dwarf terrestrial reserves. Recent technological advances in spacecraft propulsion, robotics, and in-space manufacturing have brought this vision closer to reality, while economic analyses suggest that certain high-value targets could yield profits exceeding tens of billions of dollars per mission.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Asteroid Classification and Composition</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Asteroids are broadly classified into three main compositional types based on their spectral characteristics and inferred mineralogy. C-type (carbonaceous) asteroids comprise approximately 75% of known asteroids and are rich in water, organic compounds, and volatile elements essential for life support and propellant production. S-type (silicaceous) asteroids make up about 17% of asteroids and contain significant quantities of metals including iron, nickel, and precious metals like platinum and palladium. M-type (metallic) asteroids, comprising roughly 8% of asteroids, are composed primarily of iron and nickel with substantial concentrations of precious metals, representing the most economically attractive targets for mining operations.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Near-Earth Asteroid Targets</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The most promising candidates for early mining missions are near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with favorable orbital characteristics that minimize launch windows and mission durations. Asteroid 16 Psyche, a massive M-type asteroid in the main belt, contains an estimated $10 quintillion worth of metals, though its distance requires advanced propulsion systems. Closer targets include 101955 Bennu, already visited by NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, and 25143 Itokawa, sampled by JAXA's Hayabusa mission. These smaller NEAs offer easier access but contain correspondingly smaller resource quantities, necessitating careful economic analysis to determine viability.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Extraction Technologies</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The technical challenges of asteroid mining require innovative solutions adapted to the unique conditions of space environments. Mechanical excavation systems must operate in microgravity with minimal human intervention, utilizing robotic arms and specialized anchoring mechanisms to prevent spacecraft drift. Thermal extraction techniques can release water and volatile compounds trapped in regolith through focused solar heating or microwave processing. Electromagnetic separation methods exploit differences in magnetic susceptibility to concentrate metallic components, while chemical leaching processes adapted for vacuum conditions can selectively extract specific elements from complex mineral matrices.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Processing and Refinement</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              In-space processing offers significant advantages over returning raw materials to Earth, reducing transportation costs and enabling the construction of large space-based infrastructure. Solar-powered smelting furnaces can operate continuously in the vacuum of space, achieving temperatures and purities difficult to attain on Earth. Electrolytic refining processes adapted for microgravity can produce high-purity metals without the convection currents that complicate terrestrial metallurgy. Additive manufacturing systems can directly utilize processed asteroid materials to construct habitats, spacecraft components, and solar arrays, creating a self-sustaining space-based economy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Transportation Economics</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The economics of asteroid mining depend critically on transportation costs, which historically have dominated space mission budgets. Reusable launch vehicles like SpaceX's Starship promise to reduce Earth-to-orbit costs to as little as $100 per kilogram, making space-based industries economically viable. In-space transportation using electric propulsion systems can move large payloads between Earth and asteroid targets with minimal fuel consumption. Orbital transfer vehicles designed for asteroid missions can achieve economies of scale by servicing multiple targets during extended missions, spreading fixed costs across larger resource quantities.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Market Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The introduction of asteroid-derived materials to terrestrial markets would have profound economic implications, potentially disrupting commodity markets and reshaping global supply chains. Platinum-group metals extracted from asteroids could reduce prices by orders of magnitude, making previously uneconomical applications viable and spurring innovation in catalytic converters, fuel cells, and electronics. The abundance of iron and nickel in space could enable the construction of massive orbital structures without depleting Earth's resources. However, the sudden influx of precious metals might destabilize existing markets, requiring careful coordination with financial institutions and government regulators.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Legal and Regulatory Framework</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The legal landscape for asteroid mining remains complex and evolving, governed by international treaties and national legislation. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 establishes that no nation can claim sovereignty over celestial bodies, while the Moon Agreement of 1979 declares celestial resources as the "common heritage of mankind." The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 grants American companies the right to possess and sell space resources, though this interpretation remains contested internationally. Future regulatory frameworks must balance commercial interests with equitable access and environmental stewardship in space.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Environmental Considerations</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Asteroid mining offers potential environmental benefits by reducing the need for terrestrial mining operations that scar landscapes and pollute ecosystems. Extracting resources from space eliminates the habitat destruction, water contamination, and air pollution associated with conventional mining. However, space-based activities introduce new environmental concerns including orbital debris, contamination of pristine celestial bodies, and the long-term sustainability of space resource utilization. Responsible development requires establishing environmental protocols that preserve the scientific value of asteroids while enabling commercial exploitation.
            </p>
