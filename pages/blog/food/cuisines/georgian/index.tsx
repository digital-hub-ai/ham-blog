              <p className="text-xl text-purple-200 mb-6">The supra represents the heart of Georgian culture—a sacred feast that transforms food into an expression of community, respect, and ancient hospitality traditions.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">The Origins of Supra</h2>
              <p>The supra tradition dates back over 3,000 years to ancient Georgia, making it one of the world's oldest continuously practiced feasting traditions. The word "supra" literally means "tablecloth" in Georgian, but it represents far more than a simple meal—it's a sacred ritual that binds communities together.</p>

              <p>Historically, the supra emerged from Georgia's position at the crossroads of Europe and Asia along the ancient Silk Road. As travelers and merchants passed through, Georgians developed an elaborate code of hospitality to welcome guests. The tradition was further reinforced by Georgia's mountainous terrain, where communities needed strong bonds for survival.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">The Structure and Ritual of Supra</h2>
              <p>A traditional supra follows a precise structure led by a "tamada" (toastmaster), who serves as both host and spiritual guide for the feast. The tamada's role is sacred—responsible for the flow of toasts, ensuring proper respect is given to guests, ancestors, and important values.</p>

              <div className="bg-gray-800/50 p-6 rounded-xl my-6 border border-purple-900">
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-2">The Supra Structure</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Opening Toast</strong>: To peace, friendship, and the gathering</li>
                  <li><strong>Memorial Toast</strong>: To deceased loved ones and ancestors</li>
                  <li><strong>Guest Toasts</strong>: Honoring visitors and important figures</li>
                  <li><strong>Value Toasts</strong>: To love, truth, motherhood, and other values</li>
                  <li><strong>Final Toast</strong>: Closing with gratitude and hope</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The meal itself is abundant and diverse, featuring traditional Georgian dishes like khachapuri (cheese-filled bread), khinkali (dumplings), various grilled meats, fresh vegetables, and the famous Georgian bread, shoti. Wine flows continuously, as Georgia is considered the birthplace of winemaking with a history spanning over 8,000 years.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">Traditional Foods and Preparation</h2>
              <p>The supra table features an array of traditional Georgian dishes, each with cultural significance. Khachapuri, particularly the adjaruli variety from Georgia's Black Sea region, is considered a national dish. The bread is shaped like a boat and filled with cheese, butter, and a raw egg that cooks in the hot cheese.</p>

              <p>Khinkali, the distinctive Georgian dumplings, are traditionally eaten by hand, holding the top knot (the "khubi") and taking small bites while rotating the dumpling. The etiquette includes never eating the top knot, which serves as a handle and should be left on the plate.</p>

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-2">Essential Supra Dishes</h3>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Khachapuri</strong>: Cheese-filled bread in various regional styles</li>
                  <li><strong>Khinkali</strong>: Traditional dumplings with meat or cheese</li>
                  <li><strong>Khachapuri Imeruli</strong>: Baked cheese bread from Imereti</li>
                  <li><strong>Mtsvadi</strong>: Georgian-style grilled meat</li>
                  <li><strong>Lobio</strong>: Kidney bean stew with herbs</li>
                  <li><strong>Churchkhela</strong>: Traditional Georgian candy</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">The Cultural Significance of Supra</h2>
              <p>The supra transcends mere dining—it's a cultural institution that reinforces social bonds, resolves conflicts, celebrates achievements, and maintains community cohesion. In Georgian society, the ability to host a proper supra is considered a mark of character and hospitality.</p>

              <p>The tradition emphasizes the Georgian concept of "supra" as a sacred space where hierarchy dissolves and all participants are equal. Even strangers become family during the supra, bound by the shared experience of the feast and toasts.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">The Role of Wine in Supra</h2>
              <p>Wine is central to the supra experience, with Georgia's qvevri winemaking tradition dating back millennia. Qvevri are large clay vessels buried underground where wine ferments and ages naturally. This ancient method creates unique wines with distinct flavors and textures.</p>

              <p>Traditional Georgian wines like Saperavi (red) and Rkatsiteli (white) are essential elements of the supra. The wine is shared communally, often from a common cup, symbolizing unity and trust among participants.</p>

              <div className="bg-gray-800/50 p-6 rounded-xl my-6 border border-purple-900">
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-400 mb-2">Expert Tip</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300">When participating in a supra, always listen respectfully to the toasts and participate when invited. Never refuse wine when offered by the tamada, as this is considered disrespectful. The supra is about community and shared experience.</p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">Regional Variations and Modern Adaptations</h2>
              <p>While the basic structure remains consistent, supra traditions vary by region. In Samegrelo (Mingrelia), the feast may include more fish dishes due to proximity to the Black Sea. In Svaneti, mountain traditions influence the menu with preserved meats and local cheeses.</p>

              <p>Modern adaptations of the supra have emerged in Georgian diaspora communities, adapting to local ingredients and customs while maintaining the essential spiritual and social elements. Urban Georgians may have shorter supras, but the core principles of hospitality and community remain unchanged.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">Experiencing Supra Today</h2>
              <p>For visitors to Georgia, participating in a supra is an essential cultural experience. Many restaurants offer supra experiences, though the most authentic versions occur in homes or traditional settings. The experience requires patience, as a full supra can last several hours with dozens of toasts.</p>
              
              <p>When attending a supra:</p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Arrive with a small gift for the host (wine, sweets, or flowers)</li>
                <li>Respect the tamada's role and the order of toasts</li>
                <li>Participate respectfully, even if you don't drink alcohol</li>
                <li>Try a little of each dish offered</li>
                <li>Listen more than you speak during toasts</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-300 mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>The supra represents one of humanity's most enduring expressions of hospitality and community. In our increasingly digital and isolated world, the supra offers a sacred space for genuine human connection, shared values, and cultural continuity. It's a living tradition that transforms food into an expression of the deepest human values: friendship, respect, remembrance, and hope. Whether in a Georgian village or a diaspora community, the supra continues to bind people together in the ancient ritual of shared bread, wine, and words.</p>
