            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Challenge of Financial Exclusion</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Despite significant progress in global financial access, approximately 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked, lacking access to basic financial services like savings accounts, credit, and payment systems. The majority of these individuals reside in rural areas of developing countries where traditional banking infrastructure is either absent or prohibitively expensive to access. Women, rural populations, and low-income households are disproportionately affected by financial exclusion, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting economic opportunities for entire communities.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Traditional barriers to financial inclusion include high minimum balance requirements, extensive documentation needs, geographical distance to banking facilities, and lack of credit history. Additionally, many unbanked individuals work in informal economies where income is irregular and undocumented, making it difficult to meet conventional banking requirements. Cultural factors, including distrust of financial institutions and limited financial literacy, further compound these challenges. Blockchain technology offers innovative solutions that can address many of these barriers through decentralized, accessible, and low-cost financial services.
