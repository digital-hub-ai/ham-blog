            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Evolution of Financial Technology</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              The fintech revolution has progressed through distinct phases, from early payment digitization to today&apos;s comprehensive ecosystem of interconnected financial services. Initially focused on disrupting specific banking functions like payments and lending, fintech has evolved into a holistic transformation of the entire financial services landscape. Today&apos;s fintech companies are not merely competing with traditional banks but collaborating with them to create hybrid models that combine the agility and innovation of startups with the stability and regulatory expertise of established institutions.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              The regulatory environment has matured alongside fintech innovation, with governments worldwide establishing frameworks that encourage responsible innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Regulatory sandboxes, innovation hubs, and proportionate regulation principles have enabled fintech companies to test new solutions in controlled environments before full-scale deployment. This regulatory evolution has been crucial in legitimizing fintech as a permanent fixture in the financial services ecosystem rather than a temporary disruption.
