              Frugal innovation represents a paradigm shift from premium-first product development to designing solutions that deliver maximum value with minimum resources. Companies embracing frugal innovation principles report 38% higher market penetration in emerging economies and 29% greater customer lifetime value compared to traditional approaches. As over 4 billion consumers worldwide live on less than $10 per day, frugal innovation transforms from niche strategy to mainstream business imperative.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Core Principles of Frugal Innovation</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Frugal innovation differs fundamentally from cost-cutting exercises, focusing instead on eliminating non-essential features while enhancing core value delivery:
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Essentialism in Design</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Strip away everything that doesn&rsquo;t directly contribute to solving the core customer problem:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
