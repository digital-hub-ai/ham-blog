            In today&rsquo;s hypercompetitive business environment, organizations that fail to innovate consistently face obsolescence. Boston Consulting Group research reveals that companies in the top quartile of innovation maturity achieve 2.5 times higher revenue growth and 3.2 times higher total shareholder returns than their peers. However, fostering innovation requires more than allocating R&D budgets—it demands leadership that cultivates creative thinking, embraces calculated risk-taking, and systematically approaches complex problem-solving.
