            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Foundations of Circular Economy</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              The circular economy concept emerged from systems thinking, biomimicry, and industrial ecology to address the unsustainable nature of linear production models. Unlike traditional sustainability approaches that focus on reducing negative impacts, circular economy strategies aim to eliminate waste entirely by designing products and systems that continuously cycle materials and energy.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Three core principles define circular economy approaches: designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible, and regenerating natural systems through restorative practices. These principles translate into business models that create value through resource efficiency, customer relationships, and ecosystem regeneration rather than extraction and disposal.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Transformative Business Models</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Product-as-a-Service</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Companies are shifting from selling products to providing outcomes through service-based offerings. Rolls-Royce sells "power-by-the-hour" for aircraft engines rather than engines themselves, maintaining ownership and responsibility for performance throughout the product lifecycle. This model incentivizes durability, efficiency, and continuous improvement while creating predictable revenue streams.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Resource Recovery and Upcycling</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Waste streams from one industry become valuable inputs for another through innovative recovery processes.

This design philosophy extends product lifecycles while reducing electronic waste.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Material Health and Reusability</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Circular design prioritizes material selection based on safety, recyclability, and compatibility with closed-loop systems. Companies like Interface Inc. have eliminated toxic chemicals from carpet manufacturing while developing take-back programs that recover materials for new products. This approach protects human health while maintaining material value indefinitely.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Biological Nutrient Cycles</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Products designed to safely return to biological cycles after use support regenerative agriculture and ecosystem restoration. Companies like Patagonia use organic cotton and natural dyes that biodegrade harmlessly while supporting soil health. This approach creates value through ecosystem services rather than resource extraction.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Implementation Strategies</h2>
