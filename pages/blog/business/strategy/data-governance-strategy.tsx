            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Foundations of Modern Data Governance</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Data governance encompasses the people, processes, and technologies required to ensure data is managed as a valuable organizational asset. Unlike traditional data management approaches that focused primarily on technical aspects like storage and backup, modern data governance addresses the full lifecycle of data from creation to disposal while ensuring quality, security, and compliance.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Effective data governance requires executive sponsorship, cross-functional collaboration, and clear accountability structures. Organizations with mature data governance programs report 25% improvement in data quality metrics, 40% faster time-to-insight for business intelligence, and 60% reduction in compliance-related risks compared to those without formal governance frameworks.
            </p>
