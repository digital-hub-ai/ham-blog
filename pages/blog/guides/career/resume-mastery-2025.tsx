            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">The Evolution of Resume Writing</h2>
            <p>
              Resume writing has evolved significantly in recent years, with employers increasingly relying on Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen applications. Modern resumes must be both human-readable and ATS-friendly, requiring a strategic approach to formatting, keywords, and content organization.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">Essential Resume Components</h2>
            <p>
              A successful resume in 2025 contains several critical components that work together to present your qualifications effectively:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">1. Professional Summary</h3>
            <p>
              Your professional summary should be a compelling 3-4 sentence overview that highlights your key qualifications, experience, and career goals. This section should immediately capture the employer's attention and explain why you're an ideal candidate for the position.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">2. Skills Section</h3>
            <p>
              The skills section has become increasingly important as employers look for specific competencies. Include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (interpersonal abilities). Use industry-specific keywords that align with job descriptions to pass ATS screening.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">3. Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
              Present your work experience in reverse chronological order, focusing on achievements rather than responsibilities. Use action verbs and quantify your accomplishments with specific metrics, percentages, and dollar amounts whenever possible.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">4. Education and Certifications</h3>
            <p>
              Include relevant education, certifications, and professional development. In 2025, many employers value certifications and continuous learning as much as traditional degrees, so highlight relevant credentials that demonstrate your commitment to staying current in your field.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">5. Additional Sections</h3>
            <p>
              Consider including sections like projects, volunteer work, languages, or professional associations if they're relevant to your target position. These sections can help differentiate you from other candidates and demonstrate additional value you can bring to an organization.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">6. Contact Information</h3>
            <p>
              Ensure your contact information is current and professional. Include your phone number, professional email address, LinkedIn profile, and any other relevant professional social media profiles. Make it easy for employers to reach you.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">ATS Optimization Strategies</h2>
            <p>
              Applicant Tracking Systems are used by most employers to screen resumes before human review. To optimize your resume for ATS:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Use standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)</li>
              <li>Include keywords from job descriptions</li>
              <li>Use standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman</li>
              <li>Avoid graphics, tables, or complex formatting</li>
              <li>Save your resume as both .docx and .pdf formats</li>
              <li>Include both acronyms and full versions of titles</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">Industry-Specific Resume Strategies</h2>
            <p>
              Different industries have different expectations for resumes. Technology roles often value GitHub profiles and project portfolios, while creative fields may benefit from visual elements. Research your specific industry's norms and tailor your resume accordingly.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">Best Practices for Resume Writing</h2>
            <p>
              As you craft your resume, keep the following best practices in mind:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Keep your resume to 1-2 pages maximum</li>
              <li>Tailor your resume for each application</li>
              <li>Use action verbs to start each bullet point</li>
              <li>Quantify achievements with specific numbers and metrics</li>
              <li>Proofread carefully for errors and inconsistencies</li>
              <li>Get feedback from trusted professionals in your field</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">Resume Formatting Tips</h2>
            <p>
              The visual presentation of your resume is just as important as its content. Use consistent formatting, appropriate white space, and clear section breaks. Choose fonts that are easy to read and maintain professional spacing throughout your document.
            </p>
