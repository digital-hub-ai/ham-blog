            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">The Evolution of Professional Networking</h2>
            <p>
              The traditional model of networking through in-person events and formal meetings has expanded to include digital platforms, virtual events, and online communities. Today's professionals must be comfortable networking across multiple channels and platforms to build comprehensive professional networks.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400 mt-8 mb-4">Digital Networking Platforms and Strategies</h2>
            <p>
              Effective digital networking involves understanding and leveraging various platforms strategically:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">1. LinkedIn Optimization</h3>
            <p>
              LinkedIn remains the premier professional networking platform. Optimize your profile with a professional photo, compelling headline, detailed experience descriptions, and regular content sharing. Engage with your network by commenting on posts, sharing valuable content, and publishing original articles.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">2. Industry-Specific Platforms</h3>
            <p>
              Many industries have specialized networking platforms and online communities. Whether it's GitHub for developers, Behance for designers, or ResearchGate for academics, these platforms allow you to connect with professionals who share your specific interests and expertise.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">3. Virtual Events and Webinars</h3>
            <p>
              Virtual events have become a primary networking opportunity. Participate actively by asking questions, joining breakout rooms, and following up with connections made during the event. Many platforms now offer networking features that facilitate one-on-one conversations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">4. Online Communities and Forums</h3>
            <p>
              Join relevant professional groups on platforms like Slack, Discord, or industry forums. Contribute value by answering questions, sharing insights, and participating in discussions. These communities often lead to meaningful professional relationships.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">5. Content Creation and Thought Leadership</h3>
            <p>
              Share valuable content, insights, and expertise to establish yourself as a thought leader in your field. This attracts like-minded professionals and creates opportunities for meaningful connections based on shared interests and expertise.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mt-6 mb-3">6. Social Media Engagement</h3>
            <p>
              Professional networking extends beyond LinkedIn to other platforms like Twitter, where industry conversations happen in real-time. Engage authentically with industry leaders and peers by commenting thoughtfully on their posts and sharing relevant content.
            </p>
