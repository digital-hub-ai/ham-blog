              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Renewable Energy and Carbon Neutrality</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Premier eco-friendly accommodations achieve carbon neutrality through comprehensive renewable energy systems. Solar panel arrays integrated into rooftops and facades generate clean electricity, while geothermal systems provide efficient heating and cooling. Wind turbines and micro-hydroelectric generators supplement energy production in suitable locations.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Energy storage solutions including advanced battery systems and thermal mass storage ensure consistent power availability regardless of weather conditions. Smart building management systems optimize energy consumption by adjusting lighting, temperature, and ventilation based on occupancy and ambient conditions.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Water Conservation and Management</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Water scarcity concerns drive innovative conservation strategies in sustainable accommodations. Greywater recycling systems treat and repurpose wastewater from sinks and showers for irrigation and toilet flushing. Rainwater harvesting captures precipitation for landscape watering and non-potable uses.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Advanced filtration and purification technologies enable on-site water bottling, eliminating single-use plastic containers while providing guests with premium quality drinking water. Native landscaping reduces irrigation needs, while permeable surfaces prevent runoff and support groundwater recharge.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Waste Reduction and Circular Economy</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Zero-waste operations transform traditional hotel waste streams into valuable resources. Comprehensive recycling programs separate materials for specialized processing, while industrial composting converts organic waste into nutrient-rich soil amendments. Partnerships with local artisans transform discarded materials into unique decorative elements and guest amenities.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Refillable amenity dispensers eliminate single-use plastic bottles, while bulk purchasing reduces packaging waste throughout supply chains. Digital concierge services minimize paper usage, and electronic receipts provide convenient recordkeeping without environmental impact.
              </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-800">Sustainable Travel Tip</h3>
                <p>
                  Look for third-party certifications like LEED, Green Key, or EarthCheck when selecting accommodations. These labels verify genuine sustainability commitments through rigorous auditing processes rather than self-reported claims.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Local Sourcing and Community Engagement</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Sustainable accommodations prioritize partnerships with local suppliers to minimize transportation emissions while supporting regional economies. On-site gardens and greenhouses provide fresh herbs, vegetables, and edible flowers for restaurant operations, creating farm-to-table experiences that celebrate terroir.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Community engagement initiatives include employment opportunities for local residents, cultural exchange programs with indigenous groups, and funding for conservation projects that protect natural habitats. Educational components help guests understand regional ecosystems and conservation challenges.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Future Trends in Sustainable Hospitality</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Emerging technologies promise even greater sustainability achievements in hospitality. Algae-based building materials sequester carbon dioxide during construction, while atmospheric water generation systems extract potable water directly from air humidity. Vertical farming installations within hotel structures provide year-round fresh produce regardless of climate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regenerative tourism concepts go beyond sustainability to actively improve destinations through visitor presence. Hotels facilitate volunteer opportunities for guests to participate in habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and community development projects that create positive environmental and social impacts.
