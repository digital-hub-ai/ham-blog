              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">GPS Tracking: Never Lose Your Luggage Again</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                One of the most significant advancements in smart luggage is GPS tracking technology. Modern smart suitcases feature built-in GPS chips that connect to global satellite networks, allowing travelers to pinpoint their luggage's location anywhere in the world through a dedicated mobile app.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                These systems provide real-time location updates with remarkable accuracy, typically within 10 feet. In case of lost luggage, travelers can instantly share the GPS coordinates with airline staff or local authorities to facilitate recovery. Some premium models even offer geofencing capabilities, sending alerts when luggage moves outside designated safe zones.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Weight Sensors: Avoid Baggage Fees</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Airline baggage policies continue to evolve, with many carriers imposing strict weight limits and hefty fees for overweight luggage. Smart luggage addresses this challenge through integrated weight sensors that provide accurate measurements before arriving at the airport.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                These sensors utilize advanced strain gauge technology to measure luggage weight with precision up to 0.1 pounds. The information syncs instantly with smartphone apps, allowing travelers to repack or redistribute items to stay within airline limits. Some models even provide packing suggestions based on destination weather and planned activities.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Built-In Charging Stations</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Staying connected while traveling is essential for both leisure and business travelers. Smart luggage eliminates the anxiety of dead devices through integrated power banks and wireless charging pads.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Premium models feature removable, TSA-approved power banks with capacities ranging from 10,000mAh to 27,000mAh. USB-A, USB-C, and wireless charging pads accommodate various device types. Solar panels integrated into the luggage exterior can replenish battery levels during outdoor adventures, ensuring power availability even in remote locations.
              </p>

              <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">Traveler's Tip</h3>
                <p>
                  When purchasing smart luggage, ensure the power bank capacity complies with airline regulations for carry-on items. Most airlines permit power banks up to 100Wh (approximately 27,000mAh) without special approval.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Digital Locks and Security Features</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Security remains paramount for travelers safeguarding valuable possessions. Smart luggage employs advanced digital locking mechanisms that surpass traditional combination locks in both security and convenience.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Bluetooth-enabled locks pair with smartphones for keyless entry, eliminating the need to remember combinations. Authorized users can grant temporary access to family members or hotel staff. Tamper detection alerts notify owners via smartphone if unauthorized access attempts occur. Some models incorporate biometric scanners for fingerprint-based unlocking.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Future Trends in Smart Luggage</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Looking ahead, smart luggage innovation continues accelerating. Anticipated developments for 2026 include AI-powered packing assistants that suggest optimal organization based on trip itineraries, augmented reality interfaces for maintenance diagnostics, and integration with smart home ecosystems for pre-trip preparation automation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sustainability also drives future design, with manufacturers incorporating recycled materials and modular components that extend product lifespans. Self-healing materials and enhanced durability features promise reduced replacement cycles, aligning with environmentally conscious consumer values.
