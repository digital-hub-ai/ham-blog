            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Land of Fire and Ice</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Iceland stands as one of the world's most geologically active countries, where volcanic eruptions and 
              geothermal activity shape a landscape of unparalleled beauty. The island nation sits atop the Mid-Atlantic 
              Ridge, creating a unique environment where fire and ice coexist in dramatic harmony.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The country's diverse terrain encompasses glaciers, volcanoes, geysers, hot springs, fjords, and lava fields, 
              making it a paradise for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers. With a population of just over 370,000 
              people concentrated primarily in the capital region, much of Iceland remains pristine wilderness waiting 
              to be explored.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Golden Circle: Gateway to Iceland's Natural Wonders</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The Golden Circle route encompasses three of Iceland's most iconic attractions within a relatively compact 
              area, making it an ideal introduction to the country's geological marvels. Þingvellir National Park holds 
              dual significance as both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the location of the world's first parliament, 
              established in 930 AD.
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-emerald-50 border border-emerald-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-emerald-800">Traveler's Tip</h3>
              <p>
                Visit the Golden Circle early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds and capture stunning 
                photographs with optimal lighting conditions. The interplay of light and shadow creates dramatic effects 
                on the landscape during these times.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Geysir: The Original Hot Spring Explosion</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The Great Geysir, from which all other geysers derive their name, has been active for approximately 10,000 
              years. While the original geyser is currently dormant, its neighbor Strokkur erupts reliably every 5-10 
              minutes, shooting boiling water up to 40 meters into the air.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The geothermal area surrounding these features showcases the raw power of Iceland's volcanic activity, 
              with bubbling mud pots, steaming fumaroles, and colorful mineral deposits creating an otherworldly atmosphere. 
              The sulfuric smell and constant hissing sounds serve as reminders of the geological forces constantly reshaping 
              the landscape beneath visitors' feet.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Gullfoss: The Golden Falls</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Gullfoss, translating to "Golden Falls," cascades in two stages into a rugged canyon carved by glacial 
              meltwater. The waterfall's distinctive golden hue comes from sediment suspended in the water, particularly 
              noticeable during sunny days when sunlight refracts through the mist.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The falls hold historical significance as well, having been saved from industrial development in the early 
              20th century by the daughter of the landowner who recognized their natural value. Today, visitors can 
              experience the thunderous roar and refreshing spray from multiple viewing platforms, each offering unique 
              perspectives on this magnificent cascade.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Reynisfjara: Black Sand Beaches and Basalt Columns</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The black sand beaches of Reynisfjara near the village of Vík represent one of Iceland's most photographed 
              landscapes. The sand consists of volcanic glass and minerals ground down by ocean waves over millennia, 
              creating a stark contrast against the white foam of crashing Atlantic swells.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Dramatic basalt column formations rise from the ocean, remnants of ancient volcanic activity that occurred 
              approximately 60 million years ago. According to local folklore, these columns are petrified trolls caught 
              by daylight while attempting to drag a three-masted ship ashore. Regardless of their mythological origins, 
              these geological formations create a striking silhouette against the sky, particularly during sunset hours 
              when the interplay of light and shadow accentuates their hexagonal patterns.
