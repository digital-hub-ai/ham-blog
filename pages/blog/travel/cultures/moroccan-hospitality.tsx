            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">The Sacred Ritual of Mint Tea</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Moroccan mint tea, known locally as "atai," transcends mere beverage preparation to become a cornerstone of 
              social interaction and cultural identity. The elaborate ceremony of tea preparation and serving embodies 
              principles of hospitality, respect, and community bonding that define Moroccan social customs.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The process begins with the careful selection of gunpowder green tea leaves and fresh spearmint, followed by 
              precise measurements and brewing techniques passed down through generations. The tea is traditionally poured 
              from a height of several feet to create the desired foam and aerate the brew, requiring considerable skill 
              and practice to master. This theatrical presentation transforms a simple drink into a performance that 
              demonstrates the host's dedication to guest comfort and satisfaction.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Communal Dining and Social Harmony</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Traditional Moroccan meals exemplify the cultural value placed on communal dining and shared experiences. 
              The practice of eating from a common tagine or communal platter reinforces social bonds and equality among 
              diners, as hierarchical seating arrangements are eschewed in favor of circular configurations that promote 
              conversation and inclusivity.
            </p>
            
            <div class="bg-emerald-50 border border-emerald-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-emerald-800">Traveler's Tip</h3>
              <p>
                Accept invitations to share meals whenever offered, as declining hospitality can be interpreted as disrespectful. 
                Wash hands before and after eating using the provided basin and pitcher, following traditional cleansing rituals 
                that purify both body and spirit before communal dining experiences.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Urban Sophistication and Rural Traditions</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Moroccan hospitality customs vary significantly between urban centers and rural communities, reflecting 
              different social structures and economic conditions while maintaining core cultural values. In cosmopolitan 
              cities like Casablanca and Rabat, hospitality has adapted to modern lifestyles while preserving traditional 
              elements, incorporating contemporary conveniences with classical ceremonial aspects.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Rural Berber communities maintain more traditional practices, with hospitality extending to overnight 
              accommodation and participation in daily activities. Guests become integral parts of household routines, 
              sharing meals, stories, and labor in ways that create profound cross-cultural understanding and lasting 
              personal connections between visitors and hosts.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Artisanal Skills and Cultural Preservation</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Traditional crafts play essential roles in Moroccan hospitality customs, with handwoven textiles, intricately 
              carved woodwork, and glazed ceramics serving both practical and symbolic functions in welcoming guests. 
              These artisanal skills represent repositories of cultural knowledge that connect contemporary Moroccans 
              with their ancestral heritage while providing meaningful employment opportunities in rural communities.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Carpet weaving, metalworking, and pottery creation involve complex techniques that require years to master, 
              with knowledge traditionally transmitted through family lines and apprenticeship relationships. Modern 
              preservation efforts support these craftspeople through fair trade initiatives and cultural tourism programs 
              that ensure traditional skills remain economically viable for future generations.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-black">Religious Observances and Cultural Etiquette</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Islamic principles deeply influence Moroccan hospitality customs, with concepts of generosity, respect for 
              guests, and community responsibility forming the foundation of social interactions. During Ramadan, hospitality 
              practices adapt to accommodate fasting schedules while maintaining the fundamental importance of welcoming 
              visitors and sharing resources.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Understanding basic Arabic or French phrases demonstrates respect for local culture and facilitates meaningful 
              interactions with hosts. Modest dress, removal of shoes when entering homes, and acceptance of offered 
              refreshments represent simple but significant gestures that acknowledge cultural norms and express appreciation 
              for the warmth of Moroccan hospitality. These practices create bridges between diverse cultural backgrounds 
              while honoring traditions that have enriched human social experience for centuries.
