          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Creative Problem Solving</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-6">
            Creative problem solving combines analytical thinking with imaginative approaches to find innovative solutions to complex challenges. Unlike traditional problem solving that relies heavily on logic and known methodologies, creative problem solving embraces unconventional thinking, diverse perspectives, and experimental approaches to unlock breakthrough solutions.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            In our rapidly changing world, the ability to solve problems creatively has become essential for personal and professional success. Whether you're navigating relationship conflicts, overcoming career obstacles, or addressing community challenges, creative problem solving empowers you to move beyond obvious solutions to discover more effective and innovative approaches. The key lies in developing a flexible mindset that can shift between different thinking modes and embrace uncertainty as a catalyst for discovery.
