          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Modern Leadership</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-6">
            Leadership today extends far beyond traditional hierarchical roles or formal positions of authority. True leadership is the ability to inspire, influence, and guide others toward shared goals and positive outcomes. Whether you're leading a team at work, organizing a community initiative, or simply influencing positive change in your personal relationships, leadership qualities can amplify your impact and create meaningful difference in the world.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Modern leadership emphasizes collaboration over command, emotional intelligence over authority, and servant-hearted service over self-interest. The most effective leaders today are those who can navigate complexity, embrace diversity, foster innovation, and empower others to reach their full potential. Leadership isn't about having all the answers—it's about asking the right questions, creating environments where others can thrive, and modeling the values and behaviors you wish to see in the world.

            <li><strong>Psychological Safety:</strong> Teams led by psychologically safe leaders show higher innovation and performance</li>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"People don't seem to respect my authority even though I'm in charge"</h3>
            <p>
              Solution: Focus on earning respect through competence, consistency, and care rather than relying on positional authority. Lead by example, communicate with integrity, and invest in developing your team members. Respect must be earned through actions, not demanded through title.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 my-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"I struggle to make difficult decisions that might disappoint people"</h3>
            <p>
              Solution: Develop a decision-making framework that balances stakeholder interests with organizational goals. Communicate the rationale behind tough decisions transparently. Focus on long-term outcomes rather than short-term popularity. Remember that avoiding decisions is itself a decision with consequences.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 my-6 rounded-lg">

            <p>
              Solution: Remember that leadership is about empowering others, not doing everything yourself. Delegate appropriately, build strong teams, and focus on high-leverage activities. Develop support networks of peers and mentors. Practice self-care to maintain your effectiveness.
