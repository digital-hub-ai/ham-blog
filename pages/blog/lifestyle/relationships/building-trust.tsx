          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Essential Elements of Strong Relationships</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Trust and intimacy form the bedrock of all meaningful relationships. While trust provides the security and predictability that allow relationships to flourish, intimacy creates the emotional closeness and connection that makes relationships fulfilling. Together, these elements create a foundation that can weather life's inevitable challenges and changes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Building trust and intimacy is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that requires consistent attention, intentional actions, and mutual commitment. These qualities develop gradually through countless small interactions where partners demonstrate reliability, emotional availability, and genuine care for one another.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Science of Trust and Intimacy</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Attachment Security:</strong> Partners with secure attachment styles create more trusting relationships</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability Reciprocity:</strong> Mutual sharing of fears and hopes deepens emotional bonds</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency Over Time:</strong> Predictable, reliable behavior builds trust incrementally</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Availability:</strong> Being present and responsive to partners' needs enhances intimacy</li>
            <li><strong>Repair Mechanisms:</strong> Successfully navigating breaches of trust strengthens relationship resilience</li>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Relationship partners often encounter similar obstacles:
          </p>

          <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 my-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"I find it hard to trust after being hurt in the past"</h3>
            <p>
              Healing from past betrayals takes time and often professional support. Start with small vulnerabilities and gradually build trust as positive experiences accumulate. Communicate your fears and needs clearly to your partner.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 my-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"We've grown apart and lost our intimacy"</h3>
            <p>
              Rebuilding intimacy requires intentional effort and patience. Start with small gestures of connection and gradually increase vulnerability and shared experiences. Consider couples therapy if you're struggling to reconnect on your own.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-100 p-6 my-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"My partner seems closed off and won't share their inner world"</h3>
            <p>
              Some people have difficulty with vulnerability due to past experiences or personality traits. Create a safe environment for sharing without pressure. Model vulnerability yourself and respect your partner's pace while expressing your needs.
            </p>
