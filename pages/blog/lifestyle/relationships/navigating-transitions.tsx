          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Relationship Transitions</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Relationships are dynamic entities that continuously evolve throughout our lives. From the moment we enter new partnerships to the inevitable changes that occur as we age, relationships undergo constant transformation. Understanding and embracing these transitions rather than resisting them is key to maintaining healthy, fulfilling connections.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Every relationship experiences transitions—some predictable like moving in together or becoming parents, others unexpected like job loss or health challenges. The way we navigate these shifts determines whether our relationships grow stronger or fracture under pressure. Successful transition management requires flexibility, communication, and a willingness to renegotiate agreements as circumstances change.
          </p>
