          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Emotional Intelligence in Relationships</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and effectively use emotions in positive ways to facilitate communication, empathy, and connection. In relationships, emotional intelligence is often a better predictor of satisfaction and longevity than IQ, shared interests, or physical attraction.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Partners with high emotional intelligence create safer emotional environments where both individuals feel understood, valued, and accepted. They navigate conflicts with greater skill, express needs more clearly, and respond to their partner's emotions with empathy and care. Developing emotional intelligence is one of the most valuable investments couples can make in their relationship's future.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Science of Emotional Intelligence in Relationships</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"I didn't learn emotional intelligence skills growing up"</h3>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence can be developed at any age through intentional practice. Start with basic self-awareness exercises and gradually build more complex skills. Consider therapy or coaching if you need additional support in developing these abilities.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">"My partner seems emotionally unavailable or insensitive"</h3>
            <p>
              Some individuals have difficulty recognizing or expressing emotions due to upbringing, personality, or past experiences. Model emotional intelligence yourself and create a safe environment for emotional expression. Consider couples work if communication gaps persist.
            </p>
