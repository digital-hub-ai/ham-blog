              "Injury recovery is not just about returning to activity—it's about returning better prepared. Thoughtful rehabilitation and gradual progression create opportunities for improved performance and reduced future injury risk." - Rehabilitation Specialist Dr. Comeback Strong

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Rehabilitation Principles</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The tissue healing process follows predictable phases that guide rehabilitation progression. The inflammatory phase (0-5 days) requires protection and gentle movement to promote healing. The proliferative phase (5 days to 3 weeks) involves collagen synthesis and requires controlled loading to optimize tissue orientation. The remodeling phase (3 weeks to 1 year) benefits from progressive loading to strengthen repaired tissue.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Pain science has evolved to recognize pain as a protective output rather than purely nociceptive input. Fear of movement and kinesiophobia often perpetuate disability beyond tissue healing. Graded exposure to feared movements and activities helps retrain the nervous system's protective responses. Education about pain mechanisms empowers individuals to engage confidently in rehabilitation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Movement Assessment and Correction</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Movement screening identifies compensations and limitations that may have contributed to injury or developed during protective immobilization. The Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA) differentiates painful from non-painful movement patterns to guide treatment priorities. Identifying directional preferences and optimal starting positions helps establish safe movement foundations.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Range of motion restoration addresses joint and soft tissue restrictions that limit function. Manual therapy techniques such as joint mobilization and soft tissue manipulation provide temporary improvements that must be reinforced through active movement. Progressive stretching and mobility drills develop lasting improvements in tissue extensibility and joint play.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Motor control retraining restores coordinated movement patterns through deliberate practice and feedback. Neuromuscular activation exercises target inhibited muscles and restore proper timing sequences. Proprioceptive training challenges balance and coordination to rebuild confidence in dynamic activities. Gradual progression from simple to complex movements ensures solid foundational control.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Strength and Conditioning Progressions</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Isometric strengthening provides safe initial loading that promotes tissue healing without excessive stress. Wall sits, planks, and static holds allow muscle activation without joint movement. Progressive increases in hold duration and intensity gradually prepare tissues for more dynamic loading. Isometric exercises also help reestablish mind-muscle connection with previously inhibited muscles.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Eccentric training emphasizes the lengthening phase of muscle action to develop strength while managing load. Eccentric exercises often tolerate higher loads than concentric actions, making them valuable for rebuilding strength. Controlled lowering phases teach proper deceleration mechanics and prepare tissues for sport-specific demands. Gradual progression prevents excessive soreness and ensures positive adaptation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Plyometric progressions reintroduce explosive movements through carefully controlled jumping, landing, and bounding activities. Initial progressions focus on proper landing mechanics and shock absorption. Height, distance, and speed increase gradually as competency develops. Reactive training challenges decision-making and response time to prepare for unpredictable sport demands.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Return to Activity Criteria</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Symmetry criteria ensure balanced function between injured and uninjured sides. Limb symmetry indices compare strength, power, and movement quality between limbs. Functional tests such as single-leg hop tests, agility drills, and sport-specific skills assessments evaluate readiness for return. Objective measures provide clearer return decisions than subjective reports alone.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Psychological readiness addresses fear of reinjury and confidence in movement abilities. Catastrophizing thoughts and avoidance behaviors can delay return or predispose to reinjury. Gradual exposure to feared activities and positive reinforcement build confidence. Mental skills training such as visualization and goal setting enhance psychological preparation for return.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Load management during return prevents overwhelming tissues that may not be fully adapted to previous demands. Gradual increases in training volume, intensity, and frequency allow continued adaptation. Monitoring tools such as wellness questionnaires, performance testing, and injury surveillance help identify problems before they become setbacks. Planned deloading periods prevent accumulated fatigue from compromising movement quality.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Prevention and Long-term Management</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Secondary prevention strategies address underlying factors that contributed to initial injury. Movement pattern corrections, strength imbalances, and training errors require ongoing attention. Regular screening identifies developing problems before they cause symptoms. Education about warning signs and self-management strategies empowers individuals to maintain progress.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Lifestyle factors such as sleep, nutrition, and stress management significantly impact recovery and performance. Adequate protein intake supports tissue repair and adaptation. Sleep quality affects hormone production and cognitive function essential for proper movement. Stress management techniques help maintain focus and reduce muscle tension that can interfere with healing.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Long-term monitoring ensures sustained success and identifies new challenges as activity levels change. Regular check-ins assess progress toward goals and adjust programs accordingly. Communication with healthcare providers maintains coordinated care and addresses complications promptly. Ongoing education keeps individuals informed about new developments and best practices.
