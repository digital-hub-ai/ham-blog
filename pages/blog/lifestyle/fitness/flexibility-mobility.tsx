              "Flexibility and mobility are the foundation of quality movement. They allow us to express our full physical potential while protecting our joints and tissues from injury." - Physical Therapist Dr. Flexibility

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Flexibility vs. Mobility</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Flexibility refers to the range of motion available at a joint, primarily determined by muscle and connective tissue extensibility. Mobility encompasses flexibility plus the ability to actively control that range of motion through strength and neuromuscular coordination. True mobility requires both passive range of motion and active strength throughout that range.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Joint mobility depends on multiple factors including joint capsule elasticity, ligament length, muscle extensibility, and joint surface congruency. Age, activity level, injury history, and genetic factors all influence flexibility and mobility. Sedentary lifestyles and repetitive movement patterns often lead to adaptive shortening of muscles and restricted joint mobility.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Types of Stretching Techniques</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Static stretching involves holding a stretch position for 15-60 seconds without movement. This technique effectively increases range of motion and is best performed after exercise or as a separate session. Research shows that static stretching before exercise does not prevent injury and may temporarily reduce power output.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Dynamic stretching uses controlled movements that take joints through their full range of motion, mimicking activity-specific patterns. This approach prepares the neuromuscular system for activity and is ideal as part of a warm-up routine. Examples include leg swings, arm circles, and walking lunges with rotation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) combines passive stretching with isometric contractions to achieve greater range of motion gains. The contract-relax technique involves contracting the target muscle against resistance for 6-10 seconds, then relaxing and stretching further. PNF stretching produces immediate and lasting improvements in flexibility.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Mobility Training Principles</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Effective mobility training addresses joint-by-joint needs, recognizing that some joints require more stability while others need more mobility. The ankle, hip, thoracic spine, and shoulder require significant mobility, while the knee, lumbar spine, and elbow need more stability. Addressing these specific requirements prevents compensation patterns and injury.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Breathing coordination enhances mobility work by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and facilitating tissue relaxation. Diaphragmatic breathing during stretching promotes deeper tissue release and improves movement quality. Exhaling during the stretch phase helps achieve greater range of motion through reflexive muscle relaxation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Tissue quality matters for optimal mobility. Foam rolling and manual therapy techniques can address fascial restrictions and muscle tension that limit movement. Self-myofascial release before stretching can improve tissue extensibility and enhance stretching effectiveness. Focus on areas that feel tight or restricted during movement.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Injury Prevention and Performance Enhancement</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Adequate mobility reduces injury risk by ensuring joints can move through required ranges without placing excessive stress on surrounding tissues. Restricted hip mobility can contribute to low back pain, while limited ankle dorsiflexion is associated with ankle sprains and Achilles tendinopathy. Addressing these restrictions prevents compensatory movement patterns.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Improved mobility enhances athletic performance by allowing more efficient movement patterns and greater force production. Increased hip extension range allows for longer stride lengths in running. Greater shoulder mobility improves throwing velocity and swimming stroke efficiency. Enhanced thoracic spine mobility contributes to better overhead movement and posture.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Movement screening identifies mobility limitations that may predispose individuals to injury. The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) assesses seven fundamental movement patterns to identify asymmetries and restrictions. Corrective exercises targeting identified limitations can significantly reduce injury risk and improve performance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Programming and Integration</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Daily mobility work of 10-15 minutes can significantly improve movement quality and reduce stiffness. Morning routines that address common areas of restriction such as hip flexors, thoracic spine, and shoulders prepare the body for daily activities. Evening mobility sessions promote relaxation and recovery.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Pre-activity mobility should focus on dynamic movements that prepare the specific joints and muscles for upcoming demands. Post-activity stretching can include static holds to promote recovery and maintain flexibility. The timing and type of mobility work should align with training goals and daily activities.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Progressive overload applies to mobility training through gradually increasing range of motion, hold times, or movement complexity. Consistency is more important than intensity, with daily practice yielding better results than infrequent intensive sessions. Tracking improvements in specific movements provides motivation and guides program adjustments.
          </p>
