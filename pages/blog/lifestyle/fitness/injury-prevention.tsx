          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Injury Risk Factors</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Injuries in fitness and sport typically result from the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include anatomical variations, previous injury history, muscle imbalances, and movement patterns. Extrinsic factors encompass training load, equipment, environment, and coaching quality. Most injuries occur when accumulated stress exceeds tissue capacity to adapt.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The training load-injury relationship follows a U-shaped curve, with both very low and very high loads associated with increased injury risk. Optimal training involves progressive loading that allows tissues to adapt while avoiding excessive stress. Monitoring metrics such as session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) and acute-to-chronic workload ratios helps identify periods of elevated risk.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Biomechanical Considerations</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Technique flaws create excessive stress on tissues and joints, increasing injury risk. Common movement errors include excessive lumbar flexion during deadlifts, knee valgus during squats, and shoulder elevation during overhead pressing. Video analysis and coaching feedback help identify and correct these patterns before they lead to tissue damage.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Range of motion limitations force compensatory movement strategies that place abnormal stress on tissues. Hip flexor tightness may contribute to lumbar extension during squats, while limited ankle dorsiflexion can cause knee valgus or excessive forward lean. Addressing mobility restrictions through targeted stretching and soft tissue work reduces compensatory strategies.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Muscle imbalances create uneven forces across joints, predisposing to injury. Quadriceps dominance with weak glutes contributes to ACL injuries, while tight hip flexors and weak abdominals promote excessive lumbar extension. Strengthening weak muscles and stretching tight ones restores balanced force production around joints.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Load Management Strategies</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Progressive overload should follow the 10% rule, increasing volume or intensity by no more than 10% per week. This gradual progression allows tissues to adapt while avoiding excessive stress accumulation. Rapid increases in training load, particularly after periods of reduced activity, significantly elevate injury risk.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The acute-to-chronic workload ratio compares recent training load (acute) to average training load over the past 3-4 weeks (chronic). Ratios above 1.5 or below 0.8 are associated with increased injury risk. Monitoring this metric helps identify periods when training adjustments are needed to maintain optimal loading.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Periodization principles distribute training stress to optimize adaptation while minimizing injury risk. Planned variation in intensity and volume prevents monotony and overuse injuries. Incorporating recovery weeks and deload periods allows accumulated fatigue to dissipate and tissues to recover fully.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Recovery and Regeneration</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Sleep quality and duration significantly impact injury risk, with athletes sleeping less than 8 hours per night experiencing 1.7 times greater injury rates. During sleep, tissue repair and adaptation occur, making adequate rest essential for injury prevention. Sleep hygiene practices such as consistent bedtimes and limiting screen exposure before bed improve sleep quality.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Nutrition supports tissue repair and adaptation, with inadequate caloric intake or macronutrient imbalances impairing recovery. Protein intake of 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight supports muscle repair, while adequate carbohydrate intake maintains energy availability for training and recovery. Micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in calcium, vitamin D, and iron, increase stress fracture risk.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Active recovery techniques such as foam rolling, massage, and contrast therapy may enhance recovery and reduce injury risk. While evidence for some modalities is mixed, incorporating recovery practices that individuals find beneficial can support training consistency. Listening to the body and adjusting training based on readiness helps prevent overuse injuries.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Screening and Monitoring</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Pre-participation screening identifies individuals at elevated injury risk who may require additional preparation. Medical history review, movement screening, and fitness assessments help identify limitations and contraindications. Addressing identified risk factors before initiating training reduces injury likelihood.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Regular monitoring tracks training load, readiness, and emerging risk factors. Subjective wellness questionnaires assess fatigue, stress, and soreness levels. Objective measures such as heart rate variability, jump performance, and movement quality provide additional insights into readiness to train. Combining subjective and objective data enables informed training decisions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Early warning signs such as persistent soreness, decreased performance, or movement changes indicate need for training modifications. Ignoring these signals often leads to more serious injuries requiring extended time away from training. Developing awareness of personal warning signs and responding appropriately prevents minor issues from becoming major problems.
