          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Foundations of Strength Development</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Maximal strength represents the ability to produce high forces regardless of movement velocity. This quality develops through neural adaptations such as improved motor unit recruitment, synchronization, and firing frequency, as well as structural adaptations including increased muscle cross-sectional area and connective tissue strength. Both neural and structural adaptations contribute to strength gains, with neural changes dominating initial improvements.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The principle of specificity dictates that training adaptations correspond to the specific demands imposed. Strength training with heavy loads (85-100% 1RM) primarily develops maximal strength through neural adaptations. Moderate loads (67-85% 1RM) with higher volumes optimize hypertrophy through metabolic stress and mechanical tension. Lighter loads (50-67% 1RM) improve strength endurance and local muscular endurance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Conjugate Method Principles</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The conjugate method, popularized by Westside Barbell, combines multiple training methods within a single microcycle to develop various strength qualities simultaneously. Maximal effort work develops limit strength through varied exercises and accommodating resistance. Dynamic effort training improves rate of force development and power through submaximal loads moved at maximum velocity.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Exercise variation prevents accommodation and ensures continued adaptation by presenting novel stimuli. Maximal effort days rotate between squat, bench press, and deadlift variations to maintain specificity while providing variety. Accessory work addresses weak points and develops supporting musculature that may limit performance in primary lifts.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Accommodating resistance through bands and chains alters the strength curve to match force production capabilities throughout the range of motion. Bands provide variable resistance that increases throughout the concentric phase, while chains shift load distribution as links are lifted off the ground. These tools enhance specificity and overcome sticking points.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Block Periodization for Strength</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Accumulation blocks focus on volume and metabolic stress to stimulate hypertrophy and general strength development. Higher repetition ranges (6-12 reps) with moderate loads (70-80% 1RM) create metabolic demand and mechanical tension. Volume typically increases throughout the block before tapering to allow recovery and adaptation expression.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Transmutation blocks convert general strength gains into specific performance improvements. Intensity increases while volume decreases, shifting focus toward neural adaptations and rate of force development. Exercises become more specific to competition movements, and technique refinement takes precedence over general physical preparation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Realization blocks fine-tune competition-specific abilities and prepare for peak performance. Volume reaches minimum effective doses while intensity approaches competition levels. Peaking strategies reduce fatigue while maintaining fitness qualities. Testing and competition occur during this phase to capitalize on accumulated adaptations.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Velocity-Based Training</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Velocity-based training uses movement speed to prescribe and monitor training loads, providing objective feedback on readiness and adaptation. Load-velocity profiles establish individual relationships between load and movement speed for specific exercises. These profiles guide load selection and track progress over time.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Autoregulation through velocity feedback adjusts training based on daily readiness and performance capacity. When movement velocity decreases beyond established thresholds, loads are reduced to maintain quality. Conversely, when velocity exceeds expectations, loads can be increased to maximize training stimulus. This approach optimizes adaptation while preventing overreaching.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Fatigue management through velocity monitoring identifies when accumulated stress requires intervention. Decreased movement velocity with unchanged loads indicates fatigue accumulation and reduced force production capacity. Adjusting training based on these signals prevents performance decrements and reduces injury risk associated with training in fatigued states.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Programming Variables and Implementation</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Frequency considerations balance stimulus provision with recovery capacity. Novices benefit from full-body training 3 times weekly, while intermediates may require split routines to accommodate increased volume. Advanced trainees often employ specialized programming such as the conjugate method or high-frequency approaches for specific lifts.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Volume and intensity distributions vary based on training experience and goals. Novices require lower volumes and intensities to develop technique and work capacity. Intermediate trainees benefit from increased specialization and periodized variation. Advanced athletes require sophisticated programming to continue progressing despite accumulated adaptations.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Deloading strategies prevent overtraining and maintain long-term progress. Planned reductions in volume and/or intensity every 4-8 weeks allow accumulated fatigue to dissipate while preserving adaptations. Signs of overreaching such as decreased performance, increased soreness, and mood disturbances indicate need for unplanned deloading interventions.
          </p>
