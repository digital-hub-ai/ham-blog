          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Power and Speed</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Power is the product of force and velocity (P = F × V), representing the rate at which work is performed. While strength relates to maximal force production and speed relates to maximal movement velocity, power combines both qualities to produce explosive movement. The force-velocity curve illustrates the inverse relationship between force and velocity, with optimal power occurring at moderate loads and velocities.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Speed encompasses multiple components including acceleration, maximum velocity, and speed endurance. Acceleration involves increasing velocity from rest or low speeds, requiring high force production and forward lean. Maximum velocity represents top speed maintenance, dependent on stride frequency and length. Speed endurance enables maintenance of high velocities despite fatigue accumulation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Plyometric Training Principles</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Plyometrics utilize the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) to enhance power development through elastic energy storage and release. The SSC involves an eccentric (lengthening) phase followed by a concentric (shortening) phase, with the amortization phase connecting these actions. Shorter amortization times maximize elastic energy contribution, making plyometrics highly effective for power development.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Plyometric progressions begin with low-intensity exercises such as skipping and hopping before advancing to higher-intensity jumps and bounds. Intensity classification considers ground reaction forces, with low-intensity exercises producing forces less than running, moderate-intensity equal to running, and high-intensity exceeding running forces. Volume should begin conservatively and progress based on adaptation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Exercise selection matches plyometric intensity to training goals and athlete capabilities. Upper body plyometrics include medicine ball throws and clap push-ups. Lower body exercises range from basic jumps to depth jumps and single-leg bounds. Multi-directional plyometrics such as lateral hops and multidirectional jumps develop sport-specific power capabilities.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Speed Development Methods</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Acceleration training emphasizes horizontal force production through proper body positioning and technique. Key elements include forward lean, powerful leg drive, and arm coordination. Sprint drills such as wall drives, falling starts, and resisted sprints develop acceleration mechanics. Emphasis on triple extension (ankle, knee, hip) maximizes force application into the ground.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Maximum velocity training develops stride frequency and length through technique refinement and power development. Top-speed mechanics include upright posture, minimal ground contact time, and optimal arm swing. Flying sprints, where athletes reach maximum velocity before timing, allow pure speed development. Overspeed training using downhill running or towing can improve stride frequency.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Speed endurance training maintains high velocities despite fatigue through specific conditioning and recovery strategies. Interval training with shorter rest periods challenges speed maintenance. Tempo runs at submaximal velocities for extended distances develop aerobic power and buffering capacity. Recovery between speed sessions requires 48-72 hours depending on intensity and volume.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Agility and Change of Direction</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Agility combines perceptual-cognitive processing with physical movement skills to change direction in response to stimuli. Unlike change of direction speed, which involves predetermined movements, agility requires decision-making and reaction to external cues. Training should include both closed-skill (predetermined) and open-skill (reactive) drills to develop complete agility.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Change of direction mechanics emphasize braking, transition, and acceleration phases. Effective deceleration requires proper body positioning and eccentric strength to absorb momentum safely. The transition phase involves repositioning the center of mass for optimal acceleration angles. Quick feet drills and cone drills develop the physical capabilities underlying agility performance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Reactive training utilizes external stimuli such as lights, sounds, or partner cues to develop decision-making speed and reaction time. Choice reaction tasks challenge cognitive processing under time pressure. Anticipatory skills develop through sport-specific practice and video analysis. Combining physical and cognitive training enhances real-world agility performance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Programming and Implementation</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Power and speed training requires high neural drive and freshness for optimal performance. Sessions should occur early in training sessions when energy levels are highest. Recovery between high-intensity efforts must be sufficient to maintain quality, typically 3-5 minutes for power exercises and 2-3 minutes for speed drills. Weekly frequency depends on training experience and overall program demands.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Volume and intensity parameters vary based on training goals and athlete characteristics. Power development typically involves 3-5 sets of 3-5 repetitions with loads corresponding to 30-60% of one-repetition maximum for ballistic movements. Speed training includes 4-8 repetitions with full recovery between efforts. Plyometric volume ranges from 80-120 contacts for beginners to 120-200 for advanced athletes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Periodization of power and speed training considers the force-velocity curve and competition calendar. Early preparatory phases develop general power capabilities through heavy strength training and basic plyometrics. Later phases emphasize specific power expressions and speed development. Tapering reduces volume while maintaining intensity to optimize performance qualities.
