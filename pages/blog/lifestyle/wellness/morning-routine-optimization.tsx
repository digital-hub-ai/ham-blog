          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Science Behind Morning Routines</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Our brains are most receptive to new habits and focused work in the morning hours, thanks to our circadian rhythms and the phenomenon known as "willpower reserves." During sleep, our self-control resources replenish, making early hours the optimal time for challenging tasks and positive habit formation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone," naturally peaks in the morning as part of our circadian cycle. Rather than fighting this natural surge, we can harness it by scheduling demanding cognitive tasks for these high-energy hours. This biological advantage typically lasts until mid-afternoon, making morning optimization crucial for productivity.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Core Components of an Effective Morning Routine</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Movement is essential for awakening the body and stimulating circulation. Whether it's yoga, stretching, walking, or high-intensity exercise, physical activity in the morning increases alertness and improves mood throughout the day. Even 10-15 minutes of movement can produce significant benefits.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Hydration after a night of fasting jumpstarts metabolism and aids cognitive function. Drinking 16-20 ounces of water upon waking helps restore fluid balance and can combat morning grogginess. Adding lemon or electrolytes can further enhance hydration benefits.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Mindfulness practices such as meditation, journaling, or gratitude exercises center the mind and establish positive mental patterns. These practices activate the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing stress hormones and promoting clarity for the day ahead.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Customizing Your Routine</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Chronotype—whether you're a morning lark or night owl—should influence your routine timing and intensity. Early risers can incorporate more demanding activities, while those who struggle with early mornings should start with gentle practices and gradually build complexity.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Life stage and responsibilities also matter when designing a morning routine. Parents might need to integrate family time, while professionals may prioritize activities that enhance work performance. Students might focus on study preparation and mental clarity techniques.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Seasonal adjustments can keep routines fresh and aligned with natural energy patterns. Winter months might call for more energizing practices like bright light exposure and vigorous movement, while summer can accommodate outdoor activities and lighter routines.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Implementation Strategies</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Starting small prevents overwhelm and increases adherence. Begin with just one or two practices and gradually add elements over weeks or months. Consistency with simple practices trumps perfection with complex ones.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Preparation the night before sets up morning success. Laying out clothes, preparing workout gear, or setting up a meditation space removes friction and decision-making from the morning equation, making it easier to stick to your routine.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Tracking progress through journaling or habit-tracking apps provides motivation and insight into what works. Measuring subjective outcomes like energy levels, mood, and focus reveals the true value of your morning routine beyond just completing tasks.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Common Pitfalls and Solutions</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Overambitious routines often fail because they're unsustainable. Designing a routine that takes 90+ minutes may work on weekends but is unrealistic for busy weekdays. Aim for 20-45 minutes of intentional morning activities.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Lack of flexibility can derail consistency when life gets complicated. Having a "minimum viable routine" of just 5-10 minutes ensures you maintain momentum even during challenging times. This might include just hydration and three conscious breaths.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Ignoring personal preferences leads to abandoned routines. If you hate journaling, don't force it—try voice recording thoughts instead. If meditation feels boring, try movement-based mindfulness or nature observation. Honor your preferences while staying focused on outcomes.
          </p>
