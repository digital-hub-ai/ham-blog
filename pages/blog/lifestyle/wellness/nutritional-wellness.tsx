              "Nutritional wellness isn't about perfect eating—it's about consistently making choices that nourish your body and support your goals while still enjoying the foods you love." - Nutritionist Dr. Vitality Bloom

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Foundations of Nutritional Wellness</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Nutritional wellness emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods that provide essential nutrients while supporting sustainable energy levels. This approach prioritizes nutrient density—getting the most vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients per calorie—rather than simply counting calories or eliminating entire food groups.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Blood sugar stability is crucial for sustained energy and mental clarity throughout the day. Foods that cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood glucose lead to fatigue, irritability, and cravings. Combining carbohydrates with protein, fiber, or healthy fats slows digestion and creates more stable energy release.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Hydration plays a foundational role in nutritional wellness, affecting everything from cognitive function to joint health. Many people mistake thirst for hunger, leading to overeating. Drinking water before meals and throughout the day supports optimal metabolic function and appetite regulation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Macronutrient Balance</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Protein serves as the building block for neurotransmitters, hormones, and enzymes, making adequate intake essential for mental health and physical function. Distributing protein throughout the day rather than consuming it primarily at dinner supports steady amino acid availability for cellular processes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Healthy fats support brain function, hormone production, and cellular integrity. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have anti-inflammatory properties and support cognitive health. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil provide sustained energy without blood sugar spikes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Quality carbohydrates from vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains provide essential fiber, vitamins, and minerals while supplying glucose for brain function. Fiber slows carbohydrate absorption, feeds beneficial gut bacteria, and promotes satiety, making whole food sources preferable to refined alternatives.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Micronutrient Optimization</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Micronutrient deficiencies can undermine energy levels and mood even when caloric intake is adequate. Magnesium, involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, supports muscle relaxation, sleep quality, and stress management. Iron deficiency causes fatigue and cognitive impairment, particularly common in menstruating women.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Vitamin D, often called the "sunshine vitamin," functions more like a hormone and influences immune function, mood, and bone health. Many people, especially those living in northern latitudes or with limited sun exposure, benefit from supplementation to achieve optimal levels.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            B vitamins act as cofactors in energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. B12 deficiency, common in vegetarians and older adults, can cause fatigue and neurological symptoms. Folate, B6, and B12 work together to regulate homocysteine levels, supporting cardiovascular health.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Mindful Eating Practices</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Slow eating enhances satiety signaling by allowing time for hormonal messages to reach the brain. Chewing thoroughly increases nutrient absorption and digestive efficiency while naturally slowing meal pace. Putting utensils down between bites creates natural pauses that promote awareness.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Eating without distractions—no phones, TV, or computers—increases enjoyment and satisfaction from meals. This mindful approach helps identify hunger and fullness cues, reducing overeating and improving digestion through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Hunger and fullness awareness develops through practice and patience. Learning to distinguish physical hunger from emotional eating, boredom, or social pressure takes time but leads to more intuitive and satisfying eating patterns that naturally regulate weight and energy.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Sustainable Implementation</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Gradual changes are more sustainable than dramatic restrictions. Adding one additional serving of vegetables daily, swapping one refined grain for a whole grain, or including a protein source at each meal creates lasting habits without overwhelming willpower reserves.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Meal planning and preparation reduce decision fatigue and support consistent healthy choices. Batch cooking staples like grains, proteins, and roasted vegetables creates building blocks for varied, nutritious meals throughout the week without daily cooking from scratch.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Flexible approaches accommodate social situations and travel without guilt or derailment. The 80/20 rule—eating nutritiously 80% of the time while allowing flexibility for 20%—supports long-term adherence while maintaining health benefits.
          </p>
