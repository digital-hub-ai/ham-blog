          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Holistic Wellness</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Holistic wellness recognizes that human beings are complex, interconnected systems where physical health, mental well-being, emotional balance, and spiritual fulfillment all influence one another. Unlike conventional approaches that treat symptoms in isolation, holistic wellness addresses the whole person, seeking to identify and resolve underlying imbalances rather than merely suppressing symptoms.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            This approach draws from both ancient wisdom traditions and modern scientific understanding, integrating evidence-based practices with time-tested healing modalities. The goal isn't perfection but rather continuous growth and alignment with our deepest values and highest potential.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Eight Dimensions of Wellness</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Holistic wellness encompasses eight interconnected dimensions: physical, emotional, intellectual, social, spiritual, environmental, occupational, and financial. Each dimension contributes to our overall sense of well-being, and neglecting any one area can create ripple effects throughout our lives.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Physical wellness involves maintaining a healthy body through regular exercise, proper nutrition, adequate sleep, and preventive healthcare. Emotional wellness focuses on understanding and managing our feelings, developing resilience, and cultivating emotional intelligence. Intellectual wellness emphasizes lifelong learning, creativity, and mental stimulation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Social wellness centers on building meaningful relationships and contributing to community well-being. Spiritual wellness involves finding purpose, meaning, and connection to something greater than ourselves. Environmental wellness recognizes our interdependence with nature and our responsibility to create healthy living spaces.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Practical Integration Strategies</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Creating a holistic wellness routine begins with self-awareness—regularly checking in with each dimension to identify areas needing attention. This might involve journaling, meditation, or simply taking mindful pauses throughout the day to assess our physical comfort, emotional state, and mental clarity.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Morning rituals can set a positive tone for the entire day, incorporating movement, mindfulness, and intention-setting. Evening routines help us process the day's experiences and prepare for restorative sleep. Both practices create anchors for wellness amidst the busyness of daily life.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Seasonal adjustments to our wellness practices honor natural cycles and prevent stagnation. Spring might be a time for physical renewal through increased activity, while winter invites introspection and rest. Aligning our wellness practices with natural rhythms enhances their effectiveness.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Overcoming Common Obstacles</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Time constraints often prevent people from prioritizing wellness, but even small, consistent actions compound over time. Five minutes of deep breathing, a brief walk during lunch, or a moment of gratitude before bed can all contribute meaningfully to overall well-being.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Perfectionism can sabotage wellness efforts by creating unrealistic expectations that lead to frustration and abandonment of healthy practices. Embracing progress over perfection and viewing setbacks as learning opportunities fosters sustainable growth.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            External pressures from work, family, or social obligations can make self-care feel selfish or indulgent. Reframing self-care as essential maintenance that enables us to show up more fully for others helps overcome this resistance.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Measuring Progress and Success</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Traditional metrics like weight or blood pressure provide useful data but don't capture the full picture of wellness. Subjective measures like energy levels, mood stability, resilience to stress, and sense of purpose offer equally important insights into our well-being.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Keeping a wellness journal helps track patterns and identify which practices most effectively support our well-being. Regular self-assessment using tools like the PERMA model (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment) provides a comprehensive view of flourishing.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Celebrating small wins maintains motivation and reinforces positive behaviors. Recognizing improvements in sleep quality, stress management, or relationship satisfaction—even when larger goals remain works in progress—acknowledges genuine progress.
          </p>
