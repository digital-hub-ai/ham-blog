                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI content creation costs vary widely based on tools and usage patterns. Basic writing tools start at $20-50 per month, while enterprise solutions can cost $500-2000 monthly.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI-generated content can be highly SEO-friendly when used correctly. Search engines like Google have stated they don't penalize AI content as long as it provides value to users. The key is ensuring content is original, well-researched, and answers user queries effectively. AI tools excel at optimizing for keywords, creating structured content, and maintaining consistency—all factors that positively impact SEO rankings.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Modern AI content is typically original and won't trigger plagiarism detectors because it generates unique text rather than copying existing content. However, AI content detectors exist that can identify machine-generated text. The best approach is to use AI as a tool while adding human insight and editing to create truly unique content that combines AI efficiency with human creativity.

                      Legal considerations include copyright ownership, disclosure requirements, and data privacy. In most jurisdictions, the human who directs the AI owns the copyright to the resulting content. Some regions require disclosure when content is AI-generated. Always ensure your AI tools comply with data protection regulations like GDPR and avoid using copyrighted material in training prompts.

                      Maintain authenticity by using AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement for human creativity. Start with AI-generated drafts, then add personal experiences, unique insights, and your brand's personality. Share behind-the-scenes content, incorporate real customer stories, and ensure your content reflects genuine expertise and values. The goal is to amplify human creativity, not replace it.
