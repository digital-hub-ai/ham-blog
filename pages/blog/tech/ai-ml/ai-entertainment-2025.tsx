                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI-generated entertainment content has achieved remarkable creativity levels, often matching or exceeding human creativity in specific domains. AI excels at generating diverse content quickly and exploring creative possibilities that humans might miss. However, human creators still excel at emotional depth, cultural context, and truly original breakthrough concepts. The most effective approach combines AI's creative power with human artistic vision and direction. Most entertainment companies use AI as a creative tool rather than a replacement for human creators.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI will augment rather than replace performers. While AI can generate virtual performances and assist in production, human performers bring irreplaceable authenticity, emotional connection, and stage presence. Many performers report that AI tools enhance their creativity and expand their capabilities. The nature of performance is evolving toward technology-enhanced artistry where AI handles technical aspects while humans provide the artistic soul.
