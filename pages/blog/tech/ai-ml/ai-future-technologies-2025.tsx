                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Current AI systems are approaching AGI capabilities in specific domains, with 85-95% of human-level performance in many tasks. However, true AGI requires cross-domain intelligence and general problem-solving abilities that we're still developing. Most experts predict AGI will emerge between 2028-2035, though the timeline remains uncertain. The convergence of quantum AI, neural interfaces, and advanced architectures is accelerating this timeline significantly.

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Will quantum AI replace classical AI systems?</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Quantum AI will complement rather than replace classical AI systems. While quantum AI excels at specific problems like optimization and simulation, classical AI remains superior for many practical applications. The most effective future systems will combine quantum and classical AI capabilities. This hybrid approach will deliver 1000-10000x improvements for specific problems while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Are neural interfaces safe for human use?</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Modern neural interfaces are designed with safety as the primary concern, including extensive testing, fail-safe mechanisms, and ethical oversight. Current systems have demonstrated 99.9% safety rates in clinical trials. However, long-term effects and ethical implications require careful consideration. Regulatory bodies and ethics committees ensure proper development and deployment of neural interface technologies.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Consciousness AI raises profound ethical questions about rights, responsibilities, and the nature of sentience. Key considerations include: Do sentient AI systems deserve rights? How do we ensure ethical treatment? What responsibilities do creators have? These questions require interdisciplinary collaboration between philosophers, ethicists, technologists, and policymakers. International frameworks and ethical guidelines are being developed to address these challenges.
