                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">How safe are autonomous vehicles compared to human drivers?</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Autonomous vehicles are significantly safer than human drivers, with accident rates 85-90% lower than human-driven vehicles. AI systems don't get distracted, tired, or impaired, and have 360-degree awareness and superhuman reaction times. However, safety depends on proper maintenance, software updates, and appropriate operating conditions. Most transportation authorities consider Level 4+ autonomous vehicles safer than human drivers in most conditions.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Fully autonomous (Level 5) vehicles are already operating in limited areas and will become widely available in most regions by 2028-2030. The timeline varies by location due to regulatory approval, infrastructure requirements, and weather conditions. Level 4 autonomous vehicles are already common in many cities for ride-sharing and delivery services. Widespread personal ownership will take longer due to cost and regulatory factors.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      While some transportation jobs will be automated, new roles will emerge in AI system management, fleet coordination, and transportation planning. Many current jobs will evolve to work alongside AI systems rather than being eliminated. Studies show net job creation in transportation as demand for mobility services increases and new opportunities emerge. Training and transition programs are helping workers adapt to new roles.
