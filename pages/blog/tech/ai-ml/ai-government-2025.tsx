                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI will augment rather than replace government workers and civil servants. While AI handles routine administrative tasks, data processing, and basic service delivery, government workers provide complex decision-making, policy judgment, and citizen representation. Many government professionals report that AI tools make their work more efficient and citizen-focused. The role of government workers is evolving toward policy advisors and service quality managers.

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">What is the ROI for implementing AI in government agencies?</h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      Government AI implementations typically deliver 200-350% ROI within 3-4 years. The highest returns come from administrative automation (250-400% ROI), citizen service improvement (200-300% ROI), and compliance monitoring (300-500% ROI). ROI varies by agency size, implementation quality, and specific use cases but consistently exceeds traditional government technology investments. Small agencies can achieve similar returns with cloud-based AI solutions.
