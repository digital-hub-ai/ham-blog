                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI trading systems are typically 70-80% accurate in predicting market movements, significantly better than human traders who average 50-60% accuracy. AI systems can process vast amounts of data and execute trades faster than any human. However, AI trading still requires human oversight for strategy development and risk management. Most trading firms use AI as a powerful tool rather than a complete replacement for human traders.

                    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                      AI will augment rather than replace financial professionals. While AI handles routine analysis, data processing, and basic advice, humans provide strategic planning, complex problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Many financial advisors report that AI tools make their work more strategic and client-focused. The nature of financial work is evolving toward technology-enhanced advisory services.
